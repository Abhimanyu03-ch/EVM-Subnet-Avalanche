## Setting Up Your EVM Subnet
To set up your custom EVM subnet on the Avalanche network, follow these steps:

1. Refer to our comprehensive guide and the [Avalanche documentation](https://docs.avax.network/) for detailed instructions.
2. Ensure you have all prerequisites installed, including Avalanche-CLI and a suitable development environment.

## Defining Your Native Currency
Your custom EVM subnet allows you to define your own native currency, which will be used as the in-game currency for your DeFi Kingdom clone. Follow these steps:

1. Access your subnet configuration files.
2. Define the parameters for your native currency, such as name, symbol, and initial supply.
3. Deploy your configuration changes to the subnet.

## Connecting to MetaMask
Connecting your EVM subnet to MetaMask involves the following steps:

1. Open MetaMask and navigate to the network settings.
2. Click on "Add Network" and enter the network details provided in our guide.
3. Save the network configuration and switch to your EVM subnet.

## Deploying Basic Building Blocks
Deploy the essential components of your game using Solidity and Remix. This includes smart contracts for various game mechanics such as battling, exploring, and trading. Follow these steps:

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Write or import your smart contracts for game mechanics.
3. Compile and deploy the contracts to your EVM subnet.
4. Verify the deployed contracts and test their functionality.

Ensure you customize the contracts to fit your game rules, including liquidity pools, tokens, and other in-game features.
